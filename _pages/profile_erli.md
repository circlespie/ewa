Erli Wind-Andersen is a postdoctoral fellow in the [Clemente Lab](https://www.clementelab.org/people), working on computational methods for microbiome data analysis. His current postdoctoral advisor is Jose Clemente.

He completed his PhD in Applied Mathematics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, where he focused on integral equations and fast, accurate numerical methods for large-scale electromagnetic and acoustic scattering over complex geometries, in both time-harmonic and time-dependent settings. He was co-advised by [Prof. Peter Petropoulos](https://web.njit.edu/~peterp/) and [Prof. Catalin Turc](https://web.njit.edu/~cct21/).

**Research Interests:** Numerical Analysis, Scientific Computing, Integral Equations, Microbiome Data Analysis
