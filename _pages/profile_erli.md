I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, where I focused on integral equations and fast, accurate numerical methods for large-scale electromagnetic and acoustic scattering over complex geometries, both time-harmonic and time-dependent. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Clemente Lab](https://www.clementelab.org/people), working on computational methods for microbiome data analysis. My current postdoctoral advisor is Jose Clemente.

I was co-advised by [Prof. Peter Petropoulos](https://web.njit.edu/~peterp/) and [Prof. Catalin Turc](https://web.njit.edu/~cct21/).

**Research Interests:** Numerical Analysis, Scientific Computing, Integral Equations, Microbiome Data Analysis
